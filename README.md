# die_uebung

An introductory project that aims to produce a simple German noun gender learning app. German nouns have genders, which affect noun, pronoun and adjective forms (declensions). The app will suggest a noun to the user, who will then guess its gender, before finding out whether they are correct. Later versions of the app might include tracking, so that questions the user got wrong before are more likely to come up again in the future
